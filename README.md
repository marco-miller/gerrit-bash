# Dummy project to collect informal Gerrit maintenance scripts

This project collects informal (here, bash) scripts,
meant as handy for local routine maintenance acts.

This project is currently mostly WIP, as some scripts are yet to be polished and uploaded once ready.

Gerrit maintainer or close community contributions are of course welcome.
